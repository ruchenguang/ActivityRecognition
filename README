This is a collaborated project between UCSB and ZJU on activity recognitiona with accelerometer data.
For now, this branch is for collecting accelerometer and other sensors' data (maybe later) from LPMS-B.
I'll give branches for both collecting data from LPMS-B and from Android phone directly.

Participants:
	LIU, I-Hsiu@UCSB
	RU, Chenguang@ZJU
